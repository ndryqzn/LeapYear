This version improves upon Version 1 by adding a user-friendly interface with buttons for checking leap years. 
It not only determines if a specific year is a leap year but also checks the current year and counts leap years lived. 
The program includes better input validation, ensuring only valid years are entered. 
Results are displayed with clear formatting and colors, replacing console output with an interactive overlay.
While maintaining accurate leap year calculations, this version enhances usability, making checking leap years easier and more engaging.
